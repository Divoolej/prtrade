============

PR Trade is a Slack integration for company's internal code review process. It allows developers to review each other's work by "trading" it. For a given pull request, the application will fetch all pull requests in the organization that are labeled as ready for review (the label itself can be customized) and display trading suggestions based on the file types and amount of changes in the traded pull request.

Example of usage:
- Start a pull request and label it as ready for review.
- In the dedicated Slack channel, type ```prtrade PROJECT_NAME PULL_REQUEST_NUMBER``` or ```prtrade PULL_REQUEST_URL``` (you can also display all pull request that are ready to be reviewed in a certain project by issuing ```prtrade PROJECT_NAME```)
- The application will display trading suggestions for you, all you need to do now is contact the right person and ask for code review.

### Technology stack
- Ruby 2.3.0
- Rails 4.2.6
- RSpec 3.4.4 for testing
- Memcached for storage

## Prerequisites
- You will need a Github's personal API token. Either generate one or ask other developer for the company's token.
